        You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we
        will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law,

      <p>
        <u>Verification process</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about
        whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on
        the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
        communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
        request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
        verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
        request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.

          you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict
          the processing of the data
        </li>
        <li>
          you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request
          from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
          behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
          you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a
          request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from
          the date of the request submission.
